      <p className="c3 c6"><span className="c1"></span></p>
      <p className="c3"><span className="c1">US regulators are investigating whether beleaguered crypto-exchange FTX.com mishandled customer funds, and they&rsquo;re looking into the firm&rsquo;s relationships with other parts of Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s crypto empire.</span></p>
      <p className="c3"><span className="c1">The inquiries by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission relate to the liquidity crisis that has pushed FTX to the brink, according to three people familiar with the matter. The SEC&rsquo;s scrutiny started months ago as a probe into FTX US and its crypto-lending activities, said two of the people, who who weren&rsquo;t authorized to speak publicly on the matter.</span></p>
      <p className="c3"><span>FTX&rsquo;s turmoil led to a tentative rescue offer by rival exchange Binance Holdings Ltd., which </span><span className="c2"><a className="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-09/binance-seen-likely-to-balk-at-ftx-deal-after-spotting-deep-hole&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672936720990589&amp;usg=AOvVaw3km8no6EetZlBV8WamSUYY">now may balk</a></span><span className="c1">&nbsp;as the scope of FTX&rsquo;s distress becomes more apparent.

      <p className="c3"><span className="c1">The CFTC&rsquo;s jurisdiction over crypto is generally limited to derivatives, but the agency can take enforcement action if it believes there&rsquo;s fraud or manipulation in the underlying market. The SEC claims oversight over digital coins that qualify as securities under its rules. Both regulators also oversee investment firms. </span></p>
      <p className="c3"><span className="c1">In recent days, the regulators have asked for details about the ownership structure of FTX US and FTX.com, which caters to non-American clients, according to two of the people. Regulators are interested in any overlap between management and board structures, and the financial relationship between the two entities. The agencies have also asked for details on whether customer accounts were properly segregated and the composition of the investor base at FTX.com, said one of the people.</span></p>
      <p className="c3"><span className="c1">SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly warned about risks associated with digital-asset exchanges. He has said that many platforms may be violating securities laws by offering unregistered securities to Americans, improperly providing loans, or even front-running their clients&rsquo; trades. Gensler has also raised concerns that firms may be engaged in conflicting lines of business and suggested that they should potentially split up the different functions.</span></p>
      <p className="c3"><span className="c1">Top CFTC officials have expressed concerns about the risk of crypto platforms mishandling customer assets. &ldquo;There is not enough awareness or attention on this critical area where customer protections dovetail with financial stability risks,&rdquo; Democratic CFTC Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero said in a speech last month without mentioning any firms by name. </span></p>

      <p className="c23 c18"><span className="c19">When examining the assets listed, FTX&rsquo;s accounting appears to be poorly done at best, and fraudulently deceptive at worst. </span></p>
      <p className="c18 c23"><span className="c19">Of those &ldquo;less liquid&rdquo; assets, many of the largest sums were in assets like FTX&rsquo;s own exchange token and cryptocurrencies of the Solana ecosystem, which were heavily supported by FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried. On top of this, for many of these coins the liquidity simply wouldn&rsquo;t have been there if FTX had attempted to redeem these cryptocurrencies for U.S. dollars or stablecoin equivalents. </span></p>
      <p className="c23 c18"><span className="c19">While the liquid and less liquid assets on the balance sheet amounted to $6.3 billion (still not enough to equal the $8.9 billion in liabilities), many of these &ldquo;less liquid&rdquo; assets may as well have been completely illiquid.</span></p>

      <p className="c3 c4"><span className="c1">This May and June, [former FTX CEO Sam] Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s trading firm, Alameda Research, suffered a series of losses from deals, according to three people familiar with its operations.</span></p>
      <p className="c3 c4"><span className="c1">These included a $500-million loan agreement with failed crypto lender Voyager Digital, two of the people said. Voyager filed for bankruptcy protection the following month, with FTX&rsquo;s US arm paying $1.4 billion for its assets in a September auction.</span></p>
      <p className="c3"><span>Voyager filed for bankruptcy because of exposure to Three Arrows Capital, a hedge fund whose investing strategy was going levered long on crypto. 3AC&rsquo;s supercycle thesis, projecting bitcoin prices rising </span><span className="c2"><a className="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.ph/o/ZZv62/https://youtu.be/A-U7JWz8dR4?t%3D5467&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672936720995219&amp;usg=AOvVaw1lpsfUnJOo0UsV_Z3pXVsF">into the millions</a></span><span className="c1">, relied on prices going only ever up. But bitcoin fell 60 per cent between April and mid-June as the 10-year Treasury yield rose from 2.3 per cent to 3.4 per cent. 3AC was left facing margin calls it couldn&rsquo;t meet. That spilled over to Voyager, which hit Alameda, and thus FTX.</span></p>
      <p className="c3"><span>Now, $500mn in loan losses inflicted by Voyager doesn&rsquo;t explain the $8bn hole in FTX&rsquo;s balance sheet. But it is suggestive of a larger issue.

      <p className="c3 c4"><span className="c1">[Alameda CEO Caroline] Ellison said on the call that FTX used customer money to help Alameda meet its liabilities, [people familiar with the matter] said.</span></p>

      <p className="c3"><span className="c1">Of course, low rates alone aren&rsquo;t responsible for Alameda&rsquo;s recklessness. It takes hubris to make venture investments with borrowed money, secured (presumably) against junk collateral. You can imagine a more conservative FTX, making money just from fee revenue, surviving a higher-rates world. But when money is loose, someone out there is going to run hog wild; and when money tightens, they will start to squeal. </span></p>

      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c17">He and his band of twentysomethings integrated themselves with finance&rsquo;s old guard, who, like everyone from US regulators to </span><span className="c17"><a className="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-08/ftx-crypto-bros-clashing-politics-meet-cz-chaos-on-election-day&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672936721004367&amp;usg=AOvVaw3UcVg2HLqM8iNBXq_lH6EQ">politicians</a></span><span className="c11">&nbsp;to Tom Brady, were willing to listen because they were throwing money around &mdash; the go-to strategy in the Bankman-Fried playbook.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">As became strikingly clear last week, FTX ran its business quite differently than everyone else in the room.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">While many of the details around FTX&rsquo;s remarkable collapse will only be revealed as it progresses through bankruptcy, interviews with FIA conference-goers this week show they&rsquo;re facing a reckoning of their own. The group&rsquo;s staff may have papered over the FTX name on banners across the lobby, but they can&rsquo;t fully erase the fact that many sophisticated finance pros were duped by Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s wacky charm.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">And, had things gone a bit differently, he could have radically altered not just the crypto ecosystem, but, many longtime industry professionals feared, also the critical futures market that touches all corners of finance. FTX&rsquo;s ambitions were grandiose: It wanted to carry out every aspect of customers&rsquo; crypto derivatives needs on its own, using algorithms rather than brokers to help clear trades.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">&ldquo;There are a few people in the industry that need to think hard about how someone can appear from nowhere and become the primary sponsor when others have been around for twenty-plus years,&rdquo; Trading Technologies Chief Executive Officer Keith Todd said. &ldquo;This is a wake up call. The adults need to run this industry. We need innovators, but also adults.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c17">Bankman-Fried didn&#39;t respond to requests for comment for this article. He spent part of his day Tuesday adding to a cryptic series of Twitter posts, noting that he&rsquo;s been </span><span className="c17"><a className="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1592604699693580289&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672936721005071&amp;usg=AOvVaw0bufR2Anrd8o3NgPHY-oAZ">meeting in-person</a></span><span className="c11">&nbsp;with regulators and working to see what he can do for FTX&rsquo;s customers.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c17">On Wednesday, the pain spread across the crypto world. Crypto brokerage Genesis </span><span className="c17"><a className="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-16/crypto-brokerage-genesis-suspends-withdrawals-and-originations-at-lending-arm&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672936721005456&amp;usg=AOvVaw3J9qtAmOaDHsLWSZI0uh4S">suspended</a></span><span className="c17">&nbsp;redemptions at its lending business after what it described as &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; requests to pull money in the wake of FTX&rsquo;s collapse. One of its biggest lenders, Gemini Trust Co., the cryptocurrency platform run by the billionaire Winklevoss twins, also </span><span className="c17"><a className="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-16/winklevoss-s-gemini-pauses-withdrawals-on-lending-program&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672936721005731&amp;usg=AOvVaw3_9u6M4bY0Cuym0RumEQWX">halted</a></span><span className="c11">&nbsp;withdrawals on its lending program.</span></p>
      <h2 className="c7 c30" id="h.8zafd4d73pce"><span className="c37">Not Satisfied</span></h2>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">Just weeks ago, Bankman-Fried helmed the world&rsquo;s second-largest crypto exchange, which was an offshoot of his trading firm Alameda Research.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">He was surrounded in the Bahamas by his inner circle of similarly youthful disciples of effective altruism, a philanthropic and philosophic movement that tries to have the greatest impact by carefully spending money to solve problems. The cast included Caroline Ellison, Alameda&rsquo;s CEO and Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s occasional dating partner; Gary Wang, FTX&rsquo;s chief technology officer; Nishad Singh, the exchange&rsquo;s director of engineering; and Ramnik Arora, the head of product.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">That save-the-world mentality was, in many ways, what drove Bankman-Fried and his acolytes. Though they got rich quickly through crypto, they weren&rsquo;t just satisfied being power players in the nascent digital-asset world. The group of effective altruists understood money could solve almost anything.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">Bankman-Fried worked behind the scenes to permeate traditional finance and change aspects of modern market infrastructure to his advantage. His FTX greased the palms of trading-world mainstays and quickly became a fixture in a staid industry, offering insight into just what kind of dominance he was working toward before it all went wrong.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">FTX&rsquo;s US arm, among the 130-plus entities that went bust, was striving to upend the way trading works for futures of all kinds. The derivatives, which are contracts that allow traders to lock in a set price for an asset at a future date, are a pivotal tool not just for financiers, but also for any business that might need large amounts of oil &mdash; think airlines &mdash; and for farmers, who are up against the caprices of weather and pests.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">In crypto, by contrast, futures are a highly speculative instrument, allowing traders to bypass direct ownership of Bitcoin, Ether or Dogecoin and just wager on whether prices will go up or down.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">Bankman-Fried was pushing to take out the middlemen in crypto futures trading &mdash; who are specifically tasked with offsetting risks.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3 c6"><span className="c1"></span></p>
      <h2 className="c7 c30" id="h.irifu3ahx09c"><span className="c37">Consolidating Power</span></h2>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">After buying a derivatives exchange in the US called LedgerX in 2021, FTX.US asked the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for permission to do something unusual: It wanted to execute all elements of Bitcoin and Ether futures trades, thus bypassing other exchanges, banks and other financial intermediaries.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c17">At the heart of the </span><span className="c17"><a className="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-10/ftx-seeks-u-s-blessing-for-clearing-margin-based-retail-trades&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672936721007138&amp;usg=AOvVaw0dTnn15t1XXyqoFJcH0YK3">proposal</a></span><span className="c11">&nbsp;was margin &mdash; a favorite tool of the exchange&rsquo;s users. FTX.US said it would post $250 million of its own money to shore up losses if buyers or sellers couldn&rsquo;t uphold their end of a deal. The approach would consolidate power in the hands of FTX and the supposed sophisticated technological surveillance tools it had in place.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">It was vastly different from the system used elsewhere in derivatives markets, requiring that members pitch money into a communal fund to cover defaults.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">It won praise from a venerable group of financial industry titans. Fidelity Investments, Fortress Investment Group, Susquehanna International Group and Virtu Financial were among the hundreds who penned letters to the CFTC in support of Bankman-Fried&#39;s vision.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">The old guard of the derivatives industry, including heavyweights CME Group Inc. and Intercontinental Exchange Inc., and the FIA itself, were aghast at FTX&rsquo;s brazen pitch and stunned at the public outpouring of praise.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c17">The two exchange operators had their own motivations, of course: it could be a threat to their bottom lines, since keeping all those stabilizing intermediaries in place adds costs. But more urgently, as the two companies stressed to regulators in strident </span><span className="c17"><a className="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/CommentList.aspx?id%3D7254&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672936721007775&amp;usg=AOvVaw0uwkOW4cGujgBRRa_ABsvY">comment letters</a></span><span className="c11">, it could also introduce undue risk into the whole marketplace.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">Their comments, which are looking more prescient by the day, raised alarms about the ties between FTX and Alameda. The links between the exchange and the proprietary trading firm were just one way the proposed system could pose conflicts, they argued at the time.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">US and Bahamian authorities are just beginning to untangle the extent of those connections and whether they harmed customers, as they hunt for clues to explain the ultimate source of FTX&rsquo;s multibillion-dollar collapse. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Alameda took user funds to make loan payments as the crypto market crashed earlier this year.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c17">FTX.US quickly </span><span className="c17"><a className="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-11/ftx-withdraws-us-derivatives-clearing-plan-from-cftc&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672936721008310&amp;usg=AOvVaw35o4ErB35uY_SnbGR56gX6">yanked its application</a></span><span className="c11">&nbsp;from the CFTC as Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s empire descended into chaos.</span></p>
      <h2 className="c7 c30" id="h.lf4ki74zjlwj"><span className="c37">Cornering Wonks</span></h2>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">Until Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s rival Changpeng &ldquo;CZ&rdquo; Zhao brought about FTX&rsquo;s demise with a fire sale of the exchange&rsquo;s native token, FTT, the curly-haired, video game-playing Massachusetts Institute of Technology grad was flying close to the sun.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">In Boca Raton eight months ago, Bankman-Fried wandered the white halls of the resort in his khaki shorts and FTX T-shirt. Guests gawked and fawned over him. One attendee remembers angling for a handshake, only to be admonished by a handler, who said the crypto visionary didn&rsquo;t like touching. Still, his affable, open-book attitude was out in full force. He happily answered questions on the sidelines as he bounced to and from meetings and panels.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">Sponsoring FIA conferences was a way for FTX to corner the wonks in one place, familiarize them with FTX over a drink or two, and even get a chance to influence the content. Platinum sponsorship costs roughly $25,000 to $30,000, according to FIA&rsquo;s website, and, depending on the event, it can reach north of $50,000 &mdash; still chump change by crypto standards.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">The events offered a way to come off as an approachable and legitimate player in derivatives, rather than an unknown platform throwing off cash from a penthouse in the Caribbean.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">Unlike crypto, it&rsquo;s a tough industry to crack. ICE&rsquo;s origin story begins in 1997. CME&rsquo;s roots extend all the way back to 19th century grain markets in Chicago. FIA conference attendees are fine print-readers whose jobs rely on predicting worst-case scenarios, including how market blow-ups happen. Regulators know their names and care about their opinions.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">Walt Lukken, FIA&rsquo;s president, said he hadn&rsquo;t heard of Bankman-Fried until last year. When the crypto hero made the cover of Forbes and bought LedgerX, he said he started to pay attention.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">&ldquo;There are no regrets &mdash; we always are looking for innovators, people who are coming into our space to bring new ideas,&rdquo; Lukken said during an interview in Chicago. &ldquo;It&#39;s just incredibly disappointing if it turns out to be true that there is fraud coming out of this.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c17">To gain a stronger foothold, FTX.US strengthened ties with other disruptors. It invested in IEX Group Inc., the stock exchange that Michael Lewis detailed in Flash Boys. The two firms </span><span className="c17"><a className="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-25-20/s72520-20127575-288804.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672936721009484&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pLB6iEKWDmzhaswRKbzZI">visited</a></span><span className="c11">&nbsp;Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler together in March.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">Though their partnership was based on crypto market structure, it offered an enticing pairing with an exchange that had challenged the mainstream and earned clout with regulators in Washington &mdash; a growing battleground for Bankman-Fried and his associates that may have ultimately sowed the seeds of his demise at the hands of Zhao.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s schlubby look and disregard for norms irked more than a few people, including longtime CME CEO Terry Duffy. The two clashed in an heated discussion at the Boca Raton event that lasted more than an hour, Bloomberg previously reported.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">It was largely brushed off back then. &ldquo;All change creates tension,&rdquo; said David Weisberger, who earlier in his career built trading systems for Morgan Stanley and Two Sigma and now runs crypto company CoinRoutes. Mark Wetjen, a former CFTC commissioner who was head of policy and regulatory strategy for FTX&rsquo;s US arm at the time, mused that it&#39;s &ldquo;just a natural human behavior to respond a certain way when something seems new or novel.&rdquo;</span></p>
      <h2 className="c7 c30" id="h.o2ys5j96jyge"><span className="c37">Plumbing Purchases</span></h2>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s efforts to expand FTX into the depths of financial market plumbing only grew stronger after Boca Raton.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c17">As part of FTX&rsquo;s buying spree when crypto markets were plunging in the spring, it </span><span className="c17"><a className="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/RDTW8RGFWR28&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672936721010312&amp;usg=AOvVaw1AykP2__JsdZwsHZ7_P8nY">bought</a></span><span className="c11">&nbsp;a young clearing firm called Embed. Clearing firms are yet another piece of market structure that exist to keep trading risks in check, but that few pay attention to until there&rsquo;s a reason.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c17">One example of such a crisis: Robinhood Markets Inc.&rsquo;s liquidity crunch during the runaway rally in GameStop Corp., which led to a Congressional </span><span className="c17"><a className="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://financialservices.house.gov/events/eventsingle.aspx?EventID%3D407107&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672936721010652&amp;usg=AOvVaw1rPRKLBhdQDwXe3Bf6nHZJ">hearing</a></span><span className="c11">&nbsp;about what happened during the meme stock mania.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c17">Bankman-Fried in May </span><span className="c17"><a className="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-13/billionaire-bankman-fried-triggers-surge-in-robinhood-stock&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672936721010903&amp;usg=AOvVaw0EQ58hL7EtqsxzSHsNGYps">acquired</a></span><span className="c17">&nbsp;a 7% stake in Robinhood. He spoke to people in his orbit about </span><span className="c17"><a className="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-27/bankman-fried-s-ftx-said-to-be-seeking-path-for-robinhood-deal&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672936721011097&amp;usg=AOvVaw1EcRvpP2b94VNj-qz4xIq2">wanting to buy</a></span><span className="c11">&nbsp;the whole company one day.</span></p>
      <p className="c3 c7"><span className="c11">The fate of that Robinhood position is now in limbo. Bankman-Fried acquired it through an entity called Emergent Fidelity Technologies, which isn&#39;t listed in FTX&#39;s bankruptcy filings, though it was listed as an asset on FTX&rsquo;s balance sheet. Still worth more than $500 million, it&#39;s likely to come up as FTX&#39;s more than 1 million customers look to recover some of their missing money.</span></p>
      <h2 className="c7 c30" id="h.os1mlh8lzk98"><span className="c37">Uneasy Relief</span></h2>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">In the ground level exhibition hall at the Sheraton Grand Chicago Riverwalk, participants this week still can&rsquo;t quite believe that they were so close to having Bankman-Fried again strolling through the hallways and once again stealing the show.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">Instead, Bankman-Fried is facing a possible trip to the US for questioning &mdash; American and Bahamian authorities have been discussing bringing him stateside, with conversations between law-enforcement officials in the two countries intensifying in recent days as they probe his role in FTX&rsquo;s implosion.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">At the conference, Gerry Corcoran described a feeling of relief. Corcoran is the CEO of R.J. O&rsquo;Brien &amp; Associates, one of the futures market intermediaries that FTX.US was trying to skirt around.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">&ldquo;The current system in place for the futures industry is safe, robust, and proved over time,&rdquo; Corcoran said in an interview.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">Others noted FTX&rsquo;s implosion is forcing people to look more closely at areas of the finance industry that are typically afterthoughts. </span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">&ldquo;When an issue like this happens, it really shines a light,&rdquo; said Alicia Crighton, a partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">Near the short rib macaroni and cheese congealing in a chafing dish at the after-hours drinks reception, attendees wondered aloud what consequences Bankman-Fried and his associates, including Ellison, will face.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">Despite the conference organizers&rsquo; best efforts, some of FTX&rsquo;s fingerprints remained.</span></p>
      <p className="c7 c3"><span className="c11">There&rsquo;d been no time to reprint the programs. FTX appeared alongside CME and Barclays Plc on the back cover.</span></p>
