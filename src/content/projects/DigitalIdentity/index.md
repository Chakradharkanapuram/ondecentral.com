Hacker Dojo and The Den recently invited the Decentral team to come out and be the main guests of their lecture series, with our topic being focused on Digital Identity & Digital Security. Ling Qing Meng, Decentralâ€™s founder & CEO delivered a keynote speech surrounding this topic.

At Decentral, we offer a variety of services such as (but not limited to) ZK services, a protocol audit, Tron blockchain development services, EOS development services, IOT services, etc.

We also hold access to one of the strongest smart contract auditors in the industry such as Nagu Thogiti. We work with some of the most advanced blockchain protocols, auditing tech and working to improve upon the existing products.

If your blockchain protocol implements new or advanced designs, we are actively [looking to discuss new partnerships and strategic relations](http://bit.ly/decentralinquiries).
