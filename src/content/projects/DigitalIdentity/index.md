### Overview

Decentral is building an application protocol to define the future of security in blockchain technology by facilitating interoperability across all decentralized networks. We are a team of independent and collaborative thinkers, experts in our individual domains. Decentral is developing the next generation of standards and protocols which companies and individuals will rely on as the use of quantum computing becomes commonplace for blockchain technology.

### Answer

Values (will be baked into JD, about, team, career and other relevant pages):

- _Collaborative & Solutions-oriented._ We are made up of thinkers and problem solvers who function from intrinsic motivation and bias for action.
- _Robust in EQ & IQ._ We believe genius is at its finest when paired with empathy and thoughtfulness—and the composition of our team reflects this value.
- _We are both teachers and learners._ We are a team of bright people who wish to share and educate as well as bring a sense of humility and willingness to learn.
- _Data Driven Creatives._ We believe data, logic and math are the arts.
- _Ownership and Accountability._ Know your scope and crush it.
- _Unified team._ We like to spend our time creating, envisioning and building as a unified, friendly team.
- _Visionary._ We don’t believe in thinking outside the box - we believe there is no box. We encourage our team to think big and empower sharing and developing off big ideas.
- _Diverse._ We hire based on talent and fit. Period.
