Ling Qing Meng from Decentral in discussions about sustainable business models with Rosario Dawson from Studio 189, Elin Frendberg from H&M group and Lily Oswald from PVH at H&M group Transparency Hack in Los Angeles 2018.

Transparency is a key catalyst toward a sustainable fashion industry. With transparent information on how, where and by whom a product was made, customers are empowered to make informed decisions, ensuring that everything they buy is designed, manufactured and handled with responsibility for the people and the environment. The more informed customers become, the more pressure they are able to put on companies to act sustainably. H&M group is fully committed to do our part.
