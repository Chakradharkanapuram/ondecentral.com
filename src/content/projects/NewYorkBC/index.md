The city of New York has officially help to fund and opened the NYC Blockchain Center, the world’s first not for profit blockchain space. New York isn’t giving up on the digital ledger technology that makes Bitcoin and other tokens work even after last year’s collapse of the cryptocurrency market.

Decentral Founder; CEO Ling Qing Meng was invited to be a keynote speaker at the center on February 19th.

Ling Qing Meng chose to use his time to perform a live, interactive demo of Rust, and it’s multiple uses as a newer language. We believe this raised a lot of valuable learning opportunities for anyone in attendance.
